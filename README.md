## UrbanDictionary.TV

Pulls slang definitions from <http://urbandictionary.com> and plays
them using the <http://vhx.tv> video player.

Everything is just HTML, CSS + javascript, and the website itself is
hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com/) (thanks)
